I have spring application with such endpoint  @GetMapping(value = "/countries", produces = {MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE,
      MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE})
  public ResponseEntity<List<Country>> getCountries(
      @RequestParam(required = false) String country,
      @RequestParam(required = false) Long population,
      @RequestParam(required = false) SortOrder sortOrder,
      @RequestParam(required = false) Integer limit) {

    return ResponseEntity.ok(countryService.retrieveCounties(country, population, sortOrder, limit));
  }

It looks like you have a Spring application with a GET endpoint named /countries that produces either JSON or XML responses. This endpoint accepts several query parameters to filter and sort the results. Let's break down the functionality of this endpoint:

    Endpoint URL: /countries
    HTTP Method: GET
    Produces: This endpoint can produce responses in either JSON or XML format based on the Accept header provided in the request.

The @RequestParam annotations are used to bind the query parameters from the request to the corresponding method parameters in the Java method. Here's a breakdown of the query parameters:

    country (optional): A string parameter that can be used to filter countries by name.
    population (optional): A long parameter that can be used to filter countries by population.
    sortOrder (optional): An enum parameter (SortOrder) that determines the sorting order of the results. This is presumably a custom enum that defines sorting orders.
    limit (optional): An integer parameter that specifies the maximum number of results to return.

The method countryService.retrieveCounties(country, population, sortOrder, limit) is invoked to retrieve a list of countries based on the provided query parameters. It seems like a service method is responsible for querying and returning the desired countries based on the filter criteria.

The endpoint responds with an ok status (HTTP 200) and the list of countries wrapped in a ResponseEntity<List<Country>>. The response format (JSON or XML) is determined based on the Accept header in the request.

Make sure you have proper error handling and validation in place, especially for cases where the query parameters are invalid or the service encounters errors while retrieving data.

Remember that this endpoint is just one part of your Spring application, and you'll likely have other components such as models, services, and potentially more endpoints that work together to create a complete application.

I need documentation how to run locally application and at least 10 examples of how to use the developed endpoint. 2 paragraphs, 4-10 Sentences

Running the Application Locally:
To run the Spring application locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the application's Git repository to your local machine using the command git clone <repository_url>.

    Navigate to Project Directory: Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the cloned project using the cd command.

    Build the Application: Run the command ./gradlew build (or gradlew.bat build on Windows) to build the project. This will compile the code, run tests, and package the application.

    Run the Application: Once the build is successful, run the command ./gradlew bootRun (or gradlew.bat bootRun on Windows) to start the Spring Boot application. It will start an embedded server, and you should see logs indicating that the application is running.

    Access the Endpoint: With the application running, open a web browser or a tool like curl or Postman. Access the endpoint by making a GET request to http://localhost:8080/countries with appropriate query parameters.

Examples of Using the Endpoint:
Here are ten examples of how to use the developed /countries endpoint:

    Retrieve all countries: GET /countries
    Retrieve countries with a specific name: GET /countries?country=United
    Retrieve countries with a population greater than 100 million: GET /countries?population=100000000
    Retrieve and sort countries in ascending order: GET /countries?sortOrder=ASC
    Retrieve and sort countries in descending order: GET /countries?sortOrder=DESC
    Retrieve top 5 countries by population: GET /countries?limit=5
    Retrieve countries with a name containing "Kingdom" and population over 50 million: GET /countries?country=Kingdom&population=50000000
    Retrieve countries with default sorting and limit: GET /countries?sortOrder=DEFAULT&limit=10
    Retrieve countries with a name containing "Republic" and population over 1 million: GET /countries?country=Republic&population=1000000
    Retrieve countries with no filter but limited to 3 results: GET /countries?limit=3

These examples showcase various ways to interact with the endpoint using different combinations of query parameters to filter, sort, and limit the results. You can adjust the query parameters to explore the functionality further.

application on maven change instruction

Sure, if your Spring application is built using Maven instead of Gradle, the instructions for running the application locally would be slightly different. Here's how you can run the application using Maven:

Running the Application Locally with Maven:

    Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the application's Git repository to your local machine using the command git clone <repository_url>.

    Navigate to Project Directory: Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the cloned project using the cd command.

    Build the Application: Run the command mvn clean install to build the project. This will compile the code, run tests, and package the application.

    Run the Application: Once the build is successful, run the command mvn spring-boot:run to start the Spring Boot application. It will start an embedded server, and you should see logs indicating that the application is running.

    Access the Endpoint: With the application running, open a web browser or a tool like curl or Postman. Access the endpoint by making a GET request to http://localhost:8080/countries with appropriate query parameters.

The rest of the instructions for using the endpoint and the examples provided in the previous response would remain the same.

Please note that the commands mvn clean install and mvn spring-boot:run are used with the assumption that you have Maven installed on your system and added to your system's PATH. If you encounter any issues, make sure to troubleshoot based on the specific error messages you receive.
